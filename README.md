# CT-Scan-ILD-Machine-Learning

This was a research project conducted in Fall 2023 during my internship at The Kamaleswaran Lab in Emory University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. The goal of this project was to correctly classify diseased and non-diseased patients of Interstitial Lung Disease, with CT scans as input. Moreover, accomplishing this would contribute to the effort of enhancing critical care of ILD patients and the timeliness of ILD treatments, and expanding the field of Clinical Decisions Support Systems.
